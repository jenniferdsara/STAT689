    "In class, we learned that the least squares (LS) based regression model (e.g., ridge regression) is sensitive to the outliers existed in the dataset, which can bias the prediction of the fitted regression model. Machine learning (ML) techniques, as advanced statistical learning methods, have achieved great success in many disciplinaries. However, we have a question, that is, if a dataset is contaminated by outliers, will the ML methods, especially the LS based ML method, be affected by these outliers when using them to fit the contaminated dataset? If so, how far they will be negatively affected compared to the ridge regression? In this project, we would like to investigate how outliers affect the LS based ML models, explore the levels of negative interferences affected by outliers between LS based ML models and ridge regression, and validate the performance of existing solutions to reduce the negative affect of outliers for LS based ML techniques and ridge regression. Specifically, the main contributions in this project is organized as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We investigated a well-known LS based ML method, called least squares support vector regression (LS-SVR), which is originally developed by Suykens et al. (2002). The prediction performance between LS-SVR and ridge regression for a simulated dataset excluding the outliers is first compared to illustrate their original prediction capabilities (i.e., prediction is not negatively affected by outliers).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We randomly added the outliers to the simulated dataset. The size of outliers we added equals to the 10 percent of the total number of the simulated dataset. Then we re-fited these two models to the simulated dataset contaminated by the outliers, and the prediction performance of these two models for the contaminated dataset is compared as well as the comparision with those on the simulated dataset excluding outliers is also performed. Through this comparison, the levels of negative interferences affected by outliers between LS-SVR and ridge regression can be identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Two existing solutions to reduce the negative affect of outliers for LS-SVR and ridge regression were studied. The one for LS-SVR is called weighted LS-SVR, which is originally developed by Suykens et al. (2002), and another for ridge regression is called weighted LS, which is a well-known approach. The prediction performance of these two weighted models for the contaminated simulated dataset is compared and the performance comparison between these weighted and unweighted models is also conducted such that the effectiveness of these two existing solutions can be validated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. All of the codes regarding the developments of LS-SVR, ridge regression, weighted LS-SVR, and weighted ridge regression are developed from scratch using R programming language by the authors. There is no any packages used in this project. The detailed programming procedures are also presented."

In this project, we use an exhaustive serach optimization algorithm, called grid search, to tune these two hyper-parameters. We use this global optimization algorithm rather than others aforementioned is because other global optimization algorithms typically include a stochastic process and are sensitive to the initial values. On the contrary, grid search algorithm can guarantee that the optimum hyper-parameters can be achieved as long as the parameter space is apropriately defined. The parameter space we set is $\\{e^{-10:2:10}\\}$ for these two hyper-parameters.\n",

    "From the results above (left figure) , it is obviously observed that the LS-SVR can perfectly fit the simulated dataset, while the ridge regression with 10-order polynomial performs worse in some regions. This comparison illustrates that the LS-SVR, as advanced statistical learning approach, can discover the true nonlinear relation of the data, while the ridge regression fails to reflect the true nonlinear relation of the data if the good predictors are unknown (e.g., here we use cbind(rep(1,n), $x$, $x^2$, $x^3$, $x^4$, $x^5$, $x^6$, $x^7$, $x^8$, $x^9$, $x^{10}$) as the potential predictors).\n",

    "From the results above (right figure), it observes that if true predictors are known (here we use cbind(rep(1,n), $sin2x$, $e^{-16x^2}$) as the true predictor), the ridge regression can give the best prediction. However, in the real world, the good predictors for physical phenomenon is typically unknown. In this case, machine learning method may be a good way to model the physical phenomenon at the expense of explaination. "

Two extra new function called $weightfun$ and $trainwlssvr$ are developed for computing the weight $\\omega$, new $\\alpha$ and $b$. The function $trainwlssvr$ is similar to $trainlssvr$ except there is extra variable, weight, is added and the expression of Gamma is modified.

    "From the results above (left figure), it is obviously observed that the weighted LS-SVR (WLS-SVR) (green line) improves the fitting of LS-SVR (red line) when the dataset is contaminated by the outliers. Specifically, the improvement done by WLS-SVR is achieved across all the regions contaminated by outliers. \n",

    "For the weighted ridge regression (right figure), the improvement done by weighted ridge regression is not obvious compared to the result obtained by ridge regression. Specifically, the relatively obvious improvement is located at one end, while other regions contaminated by outliers are not improved."

    "## 7. Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "From this comparision studies, the following conclusions are made to answer the questions we have in the motivation section.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the true predictors are unknown, the LS-SVR is an effective tool capable of modeling the nonlinear behavior of physical phenomenon at the expense of explaination. On the contrary, the ridge regression can explain the fitted model but typically gives poor prediction. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. When the true predicthors are known, the ridge regression performs even better than LS-SVR (note: the true predictors are not used for machine learning). However, the true predictors for some physical phenomenon are always unknown. Almost all of the disciplinaries aims to explore what are the true predictors affecting some physical phenomenon. In this situation, machine learning methods might be a potential way to assist people to understand how some physical phenonmenon happens in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The ridge regression is more vulnerable to outliers than LS-SVR when the true predictors are unknown. However, if the true predictors are known, the ridge regression is more robust than LS-SVR.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Weighted least squares methods can improve the fitting of both LS-SVR and ridge regression when the dataset is containminated by outliers. However, compared to weighted LS-SVR, the improvement for weighted ridge regression is not significant. "
